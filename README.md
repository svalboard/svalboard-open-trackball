The Svalboard Open Trackball design builds on the SideraKB PMW3360 design to make it more compact and usable for any trackball application.
This is the bare minimum footprint achievable in a single-sided SMT assembly ready to receive hand-soldered PMW3389/60 parts -- it is intended to be ordered direct from JLCPCB, fully assembled except for the PMW part, which you'll need to source and hand solder.

Note that in this design 3389 is the default sensor -- you need to cut and bridge the jumper for PMW3360.
Turns out PMW3389 is cheaper to buy on Aliexpress anyway... :D

By trimming lenses to match the footprint, you can fit these sensors in places previously not possible.
Like the SideraKB version, these PCBAs are released under CERN OHL 2P, a permissive open hardware license.

No support is offered for this design, please don't bug me (:
